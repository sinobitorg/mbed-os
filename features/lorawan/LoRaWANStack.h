     * system.
     *
     * When connecting via OTAA, the return code for success (LORAWAN_STATUS_CONNECT_IN_PROGRESS) is negative.
     * However, this is not a real error. It tells you that the connection is in progress and you will
     * be notified of the completion via an event. By default, after the Join Accept message
     * is received, base stations may provide the node with a CF-List that replaces
     * all user-configured channels except the Join/Default channels. A CF-List can
     * configure a maximum of five channels other than the default channels.
     *
     * In case of ABP, the CONNECTED event is posted before the call to `connect()` returns.
     * To configure more channels, we recommend that you use the `set_channel_plan()` API after the connection.
     * By default, the PHY layers configure only the mandatory Join channels. The retransmission back-off restrictions
     * on these channels are severe and you may experience long delays or even failures in the confirmed traffic.
     * If you add more channels, the aggregated duty cycle becomes much more relaxed as compared to the Join (default) channels only.
     *
     * **NOTES ON RECONNECTION:**
     * Currently, the Mbed OS LoRaWAN implementation does not support non-volatile
     * memory storage. Therefore, the state and frame counters cannot be restored after
     * a power cycle. However, if you use the `disconnect()` API to shut down the LoRaWAN
     * protocol, the state and frame counters are saved. Connecting again would try to
     * restore the previous session. According to the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification, the frame counters are always reset
     * to zero for OTAA and a new Join request lets the network server know
     * that the counters need a reset. The same is said about the ABP but there
     * is no way to convey this information to the network server. For a network
     * server, an ABP device is always connected. That's why storing the frame counters
     * is important, at least for ABP. That's why we try to restore frame counters from
